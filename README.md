# My-Responsive-Web-Dev-Layout

This is a working progress of my files and structure for any responsive web development project I want to do .


### Main resources pulled from is as follows:

Travis Neilson: [Dev. Tips Starter Kit](https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit)

[Skeleton Framework](http://getskeleton.com/)

[Shay Howe](https://learn.shayhowe.com/)

### Misc.
- There is a spot for both JavaScript and jQuery links at the end of the HTML file.
- There is an assets folder that houses a CSS, img, js folders.
- Within the CSS folder there is main.css (for your custom css) & normalize.css file (to start all browsers off at the same point).
- Within the js folder there is a functions.js file for your custom vanilla JavaScript and a jquery-v#min.js file to paste the current minified version of jQuery inside (you should rename the jquery-v#min.js file name to match the minified version of jQuery you use).
- There is a favicon folder inside the images folder (put special images used for tab pics and such).
